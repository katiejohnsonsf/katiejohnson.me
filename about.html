		<h3>About</h3>
		<div class="row-fluid">	
			<p class=" text-info span7 pull-right">	
			With over 11 years as a designer, I enjoy working with small cross-functional teams to envision, design, and implement meaningful user experiences. As a UX practitioner, wearing the hat of user researcher, interaction designer, and visual designer, I always strive for the best possible experience for our customers. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I currently work for Planetary. Prior to that, I headed up design at my own startup, and worked with others including Skillshare and Airbnb. 
			While working on small to mid-sized teams, I've had a chance to influence the product in a variety of cultures. 
			<br>
			<br>
			When I'm not at work, you can find me taking photos of textures and botanicals, going hiking, or volunteering for open source projects.
