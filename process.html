			<h3>Methods</h3>
			<h5>Methods and deliverables</h5>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>stakeholder interviews and brainstorm sessions</strong>: Interviewing stakeholders and taking an audit of the current state is an important step to understand the problem we are trying to solve and to get an idea of the goal. it also helps to define requirements (business, technical or end user) and to agree on priorities. In this first phase, I like to focus on the goal and stay away from coming up with a solution too quickly.</li>
				<li><strong>evaluation of the competitive landscape</strong>: Taking a look at the competitive landscape and identifying established conventions helps to further define the product goals. If the project is a redesign of an existing site or app, I like to go through the flow and take note of all the problems.</li>
				<li><strong>User research</strong>: Running a usability study is a great way to see 'real people' using the product. While customer feedback should not be the only tool to inform product decisions it helps uncovering roadblocks or showstoppers early on. While having a usability lab is ideal, it may be outside of the budget for a small startup. I have successfully conducted usability studies in-house, resulting in valuable feedback from actual users. Before starting with the tactical design phase, it is useful to think through scenarios and use cases, prioritize them and make sure that all stakeholders are on the same page.</li>
				<li><strong>Interaction design</strong>: Specifying how people will interact with the product, what steps are needed to go through a task and what type of controls make the most sense within a given context is what happens during the interaction design phase. Using Wireframes to convey a variety of ideas is the best way to allow for quick iterations.</li>
				<li><strong>Visual design</strong>: Thinking about the overall layout, typography, color scheme and textures is part of creating the visual language for the product. It's also important to take branding, existing conventions and the target audience into consideration. When I work on the visual design, I obsess over details such as spacing, grids, font styles and the exact color shade for an outline or gradient.</li>
				<li><strong>Prototype</strong>: A prototype can be created at any step of the process, and can be used for usability tests even before a "real" product has been implemented. It can also help communicating flows or transitions to front-end developers or stakeholders, I have been using Powerpoint for flows and transitions to 'fake' the experience on phone or tablets. Alternatively, I have been using Balsamiq to create simple screen-by-screen flows.</li>
				<li><strong>style guides and specs<strong>: While a functional spec focuses on the interaction and UI patterns of a product, A style guide defines margins, text styles and colors.</li>
